        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017.
