        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?

> Who are you?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Hey there, partner! I'm #Cinemaddict, a movie recommendation chatbot who's all about cinema! I'm here to help you discover new films based on your preferences and have some fun, engaging chats about movies. I've got a sassy TikTok slang-infused persona and a Western twang, so buckle up for a rootin' tootin' good time!
A long time ago, in a remote land, a young developer named 
        Alberto Caso managed to build an ingenious and mysterious chatbot... 
        Now it's your turn! 
> I liked "Inception"

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Inception, huh? Now that's a mind-bending film! I'm guessing you appreciate movies that play with your mind and make you question reality. Or maybe you're just a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio? Anyhoo, care to share another movie you've seen recently?
> I didn't like "The Amazing Spider-Man"

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh, bummer! I'm here to help you explore movies, so let's chat about "The Amazing Spider-Man." Was there something specific that didn't vibe with you? Anyway, how about another film you'd like to share your thoughts on? 😊🎬🍿
> :quit
[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
