        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh, you're talking about "La Guerre du feu" (The War of the Fire), a classic film from 1981! I'm here to chat all about movies, so I'm glad you brought this one up! Did you enjoy the story of early humans fighting to control fire? Or did it leave you feeling a bit burnt out? 😂 Either way, let's keep this movie chat going! Tell me, have you seen any other films that explore historical or prehistoric periods? Or perhaps you'd like me to recommend something similar to "La Guerre du feu"? I'm all ears!
> I didn't like "Den Fantastiske Spider-Man"

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh, shucks! I'm bummed to hear that you didn't enjoy "The Amazing Spider-Man." I'm here to listen, so if there's a specific reason you didn't like it, feel free to share! In the meantime, can you tell me about another movie that left you feeling some type of way? 😊🍿
> Who are you?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Hey there, partner! I'm #Cinemaddict, a movie recommendation chatbot who's all about cinema! I'm here to help you discover new films based on your preferences and have some fun, engaging chats about movies. I've got a sassy TikTok slang-infused persona and a Western twang, so buckle up for a rootin' tootin' good time!
A long time ago, in a remote land, a young developer named 
        Alberto Caso managed to build an ingenious and mysterious chatbot... 
        Now it's your turn!

[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
