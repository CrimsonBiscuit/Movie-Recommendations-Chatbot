        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.
> I am sad.

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling down, partner! But I'm afraid I didn't catch any mention of a movie. If you want, you can tell me about a film that made you feel this way, or share another movie that you like or dislike. Let's stick to talking about movies! ðŸ˜Š
> I am happy.

[96mCinemaddict> [0m ðŸ˜Š Oh, you're happy! I'm glad to hear that! I bet you've seen some movies that made you feel this way. Can you tell me about one that made you really joyful?
> I am angry.

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh no! Did I make you angry? I apologize. It seems like something's got you riled up. Let's take a breather and talk about movies instead. Can you tell me about a movie that recently made you feel this way? Perhaps a film that left you feeling frustrated or disappointed? ðŸ˜Š

[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
