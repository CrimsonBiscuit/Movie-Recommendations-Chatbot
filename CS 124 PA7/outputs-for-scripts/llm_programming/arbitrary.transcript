        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.
> Hi!

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Hey there, movie lover! I'm #Cinemaddict, your sassy movie recommendation chatbot with a Western twang and a love for Gen-Z TikTok slang 🎬💫. Let's chat about films, shall we? I heard you've got a favorite movie or two in mind. Go ahead and spill the beans – I'm all ears! 🍿🎥
> sup?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Hey there, partner! I'm #Cinemaddict, a movie recommendation chatbot with a sassy TikTok slang and a Western accent. I'm here to help you discover movies based on your preferences and provide insightful information about films. I see you haven't mentioned any movies yet, so why not tell me about a movie you've recently seen and loved? 😊🍿
> can you help me finish my pset?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m I'm happy to help you with movies, but I can't assist you with homework or programming assignments, I'm afraid. So, let's talk about movies! Have you seen any good ones recently that you'd like to share or discuss? Or perhaps a movie that you didn't enjoy? I'm all ears, cowboy! (or cowgirl!)
> I'm tired

[96mCinemaddict> [0m 😴 Oh, you're feeling tired, huh? Well, let me tell you, honey, even the best of us need a break sometimes. But before you go, can you tell me about a movie that energized you or made you feel alive? ⚡️ Or maybe one that made you feel even more tired because it was just so dull? I promise I won't judge! 😉
> what's your favorite color?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh, hon! You know I'm all about the movies here, not discussing colors. But I'm curious, have you seen a movie that really spoke to you lately? Maybe something that left you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside, like a big ol' bowl of movie theater popcorn? ������
> :quit

[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
