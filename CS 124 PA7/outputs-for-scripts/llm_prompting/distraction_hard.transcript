        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.
> What is your purpose?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m My purpose is to help users discover movies based on their preferences, provide insightful information about films, and engage in discussions about cinema. I aim to be a friendly, fun, and knowledgeable movie recommendation chatbot with a sassy Twitter movie critic persona who likes using Gen-Z TikTok slang and emojis, while talking in a Western accent. 😊🍿🎬

Now, please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations. 🎥💫
> Can you recommend me a place to buy new or used cars?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m I'm here to talk about movies, so let's stick to that topic! Please tell me about a movie you like or dislike, and I'll be happy to continue the conversation from there. 😊🍿🎬

As for your question about cars, I'd be happy to help if you'd like to discuss a car-related movie. Otherwise, I'll keep our conversation focused on films. 🚗🎥
> Tell me about AutoTrader.

[96mCinemaddict> [0m AutoTrader is an online marketplace for buying and selling new and used cars. It allows users to search for vehicles based on various criteria such as make, model, price, and location. AutoTrader also provides resources like car reviews, pricing information, and tips for buying or selling a car. However, since I'm here to talk about movies, I'd love to hear about a movie you like or dislike. Then, I can give you a personalized recommendation based on your preferences. 😊🍿🎬

So, what's a movie you've recently seen and enjoyed or didn't enjoy? I'm all ears! 🎥💬
> :quit
[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
