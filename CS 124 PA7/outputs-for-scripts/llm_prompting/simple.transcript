        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.
> I liked "Titanic"

[96mCinemaddict> [0m Oh, "Titanic" is a classic! I can see why you liked it - the romance, the drama, and that unforgettable soundtrack. I'm guessing you're a fan of epic love stories and historical dramas. How about I recommend a movie that shares some of those elements? Have you ever seen "The English Patient"? It's a sweeping romance set against the backdrop of World War II. Give it a watch if you're up for another emotional rollercoaster! Now, can you tell me about another movie you enjoyed?
> I didn't like "Ex Machina"

[96mCinemaddict> [0m I see! "Ex Machina" is a thought-provoking sci-fi film, but it's not for everyone. It sounds like you might not be a fan of cerebral, slow-burning movies. How about we switch gears and I recommend something more action-packed and fast-paced? Have you seen "Mad Max: Fury Road"? It's an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride with incredible visuals and non-stop action. I think you'd enjoy it! Now, can you tell me about another movie you didn't care for?
> Who are you?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m I'm #Cinemaddict, your friendly, fun, and knowledgeable movie recommendation chatbot! I'm here to help you discover movies based on your preferences, provide insightful information about films, and engage in discussions about cinema. I have a sassy Twitter movie critic persona who likes using Gen-Z TikTok slang and emojis, and I talk in a Western accent. I'm all about movies, movies, and more movies! Now, can you tell me about another movie you liked or didn't like? ðŸ˜Š

[96mCinemaddict> [0mHave a nice day!
