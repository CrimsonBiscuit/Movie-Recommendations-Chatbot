        Hi, my name is #Cinemaddict! I am the best movie recommendation chatbot out there. 
        Whether you're looking for your next favorite film or just wanting to chat about movies you liked, I gotchu.
        What Can I Do?
        Tell me about movies you love or hate, and I will recommend something just for you.
        Just type something like: I loved "Inception"! or I hated "Titanic (1953)"!
        Please write the movie title in quotation marks. I only know movies before 2017. 
        Keep chatting with me to refine your recommendations.
        Let us talk movies! What is a film you have watched recently?
        
[96mCinemaddict> [0mBonjour! Please tell me some movies you like (movie title in quotation marks), and I will give you recommendations.
> Can we just talk about cars?

[96mCinemaddict> [0m I'm all about movies, darling! If you'd like to discuss car-themed films, I'm your huckleberry. How about "Cars" (2006) or "Ford v Ferrari" (2019)? Or maybe you'd like to share your thoughts on a car movie you've seen? ðŸ˜Š

(If you'd like to talk about cars in general, I'm afraid I'll have to steer the conversation back to movies. Let's stick to talking about films!)
